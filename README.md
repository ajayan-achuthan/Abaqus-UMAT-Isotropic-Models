# Abaqus UMAT Isotropic Models

A collection of **Fortran** subroutines for **Abaqus/Standard** implementing fundamental material behaviors. This repository serves as a technical foundation for finite element simulations involving elastic and plastic deformations.
developed for an M.Tech Project.

### 🛠 Implemented Models
*   **Linear Elasticity**: Isotropic Hooke’s Law (Standard verification model).
*   **Linear Kinematic Hardening**: Captures the Bauschinger effect for cyclic loading.
*   **Hollomon Law**: Power-law hardening ($\sigma = K\epsilon^n$) for monotonic plastic flow.
