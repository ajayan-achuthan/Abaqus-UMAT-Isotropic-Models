# Abaqus UMAT Isotropic Models

 A collection of **Fortran** subroutines for **Abaqus/Standard** implementing fundamental material behaviors. This repository serves as a technical foundation for finite element simulations involving elastic and plastic deformations. Developed as part of an M.Tech Project .

## 🛠 Implemented Models

*   **Linear Elasticity**: Implementation of Isotropic Hooke’s Law. Used as a standard verification model for the UMAT interface.
*   **Linear Kinematic Hardening**: Captures the Bauschinger effect, essential for modeling material behavior under cyclic loading.
*   **Hollomon Law**: A power-law hardening model ($\sigma = K\epsilon^n$) designed for monotonic plastic flow analysis.
